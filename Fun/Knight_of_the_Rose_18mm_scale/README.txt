# Summary

This character was modeled for our sci-fantasy tabletop RPG, [Wayfarer: Things Beyond Wonder](http://www.illgottengames.net/wayfarer/) and for [Wayfarer Tactics](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1227640) (a stat card for this is included with the pictures). If you want to print a 28mm scale version, just scale it up by 166.6%.

We've set up a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/illgottengames) for anyone who's interested in helping to fund us so we can keep making free and open sourced games like Pocket-Tactics, Wayfarer Tactics. and others, not to mention the growing catalog of gaming miniatures that you can use for whatever you want! (Psst... we take requests and commissions...)

Enjoy!
