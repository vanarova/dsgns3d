# Summary

This Tablet / Phone stand is a super simple stylish design. The stand was designed to be as small as possible, so it is quick and easy to print as well as not consuming a lot of filament, but adequate to hold most tablets and phones in either orientation. 

You can use a tablet or phone in the stand however if it slides around too much on hard surfaces (as plastic can) the base / footprint could easily have thin foam  rubber padding added to make it non-slip.   

Seven files have been provided to accommodate devices from <7mm thick up to 13mm thick. Just measure the thickness of your tablet or phone and print the file of the next size up..... so a tablet measuring 8.25mm is best in the 9mm stand. This ensures a snug fit. It's easy... but please remember clearance is required so a 10mm thick device will not fit a 10mm stand... print the 11mm stand. 

The Tablet / Phone Stand should work well for most tablets and phones provided the correct file is used for a snug fit. 

This is a super easy print. Print them in your favourite color/s (pause and change colours part way through if you want to get creative) and great as a small gift. 

Please refer to the print settings and images for additional information... and please post images of your stand/s in use for others to see.
